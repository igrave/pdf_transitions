## PDF Transitions

*Slide transitions for PDFs*

If you have created your presentation as a PDF (e.g. with latex/beamer etc)
you might be missing out on slide transitions. If you had computer classes
involving Powerpoint in the 90s you'll know this is essential for an effective
presentation.

Simple upload your PDF file and set the transition.
